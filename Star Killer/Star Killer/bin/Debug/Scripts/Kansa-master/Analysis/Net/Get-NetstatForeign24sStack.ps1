.SYNOPSIS
Get-NetstatForeign24sStack.ps1
Requires logparser.exe in path
Pulls stack rank of Netstat connections aggregating 
on Protocol, first three octets of ForeignAddress, 
State, Component and Process

You may want to customize this a bit for
your environment. If you're running web 
servers, for example, stacking them may be
meaningless if they are meant to accept 
connections from any host in the world, or
maybe you just remove the web server process
from the query...

!! YOU WILL LIKELY WANT TO ADJUST THIS QUERY !!

This script exepcts files matching the pattern 
*netstat.csv to be in the current working
directory
