CAPICOM 2.1.0.1
================

The CAPICOM Team is pleased to announce the general availability of CAPICOM 
2.1.0.1. This new version of CAPICOM contains the following new features:

    + CertificateStatus: A new Certificates collection property that allows 
      the caller to set or retrieve the set of additional certificates that 
      may be useful during certificate chain building.
    + CertificateStatus.CheckFlag now defaults to CAPICOM_CHECK_ONLINE_ALL
    + Store: 2 new methods and 2 new properties are available on the Store 
      object. 
        + Delete: Allows the caller to delete non-system certificate stores. 
        + Close: Allows the caller to close a certificate store. This method 
          was added to address limitations in the JScript engine and is not 
          needed in other environments.
        + Name: Allows the caller to retrieve the name of a certificate store
        + Location: Allows the caller to retrieve the location 
          (CAPICOM_STORE_LOCATION) of a certificate store	
    + HashedData: Additional hash algorithms have been defined for SHA256, 
      SHA384 and SHA512. Note that these algorithms are not available on 
      Windows XP or below.

    + CHashData.vbs has been updated to use the new hash algorithms
    + Storesh.cs has been updated to use the new Delete method.

CAPICOM 2.1.0.1 also addresses several bugs including:

    + Memory leak when calling SignedData.Signers.Items or 
      SignedData.Cetificates.Item in a loop
    + The Certficate status object does not return an error when the 
      Certificate Signing bit is not set in the Key Usage extension of a CA 
      certificate in the chain.
    + Changes made to a Certificate object retrieved from a collection 
      returned by a Find not persisted.	


Known Issues include:
    + Exporting keys to a PKCS12/PFX file fails on Windows 2000 and 
      Windows XP with keys that are marked non-exportable even if 
      CAPICOM_EXPORT_IGNORE_PRIVATE_KEY_NOT_EXPORTABLE_ERROR has been 
      specified.
    + It is not possible to view the contents of a SignedData object if it is 
      signature invalid. As a work around users can use the Certificates 
      object to open the Pkcs7 and find the signer certificate.
    + The CVersion.vbs incorectly identifies the 2.0.0.3 release as version 
      2.0.
