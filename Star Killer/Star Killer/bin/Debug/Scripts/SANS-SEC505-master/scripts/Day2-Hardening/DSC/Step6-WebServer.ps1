# This step is not one of the required steps to "bootstrap"
# a machine into being ready to receive a DSC configuration. 
# 
# This script is an example of how real work can be done with 
# DSC now that all necessary resource modules have (hopefully)
# been installed in the prior steps.  Hence, we are done 
# getting ready to use DSC, we can now use DSC.
