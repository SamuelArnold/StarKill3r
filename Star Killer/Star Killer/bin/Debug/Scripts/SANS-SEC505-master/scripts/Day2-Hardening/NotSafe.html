<h2>Demo: ActiveX Control Not Safe for Scripting</h2>
<pre>
When you first accessed this page with Internet Explorer, you 
should have seen an error message.  This is good, the web page 
is trying to launch REGEDIT.EXE on your computer, but it could 
have tried to execute any command whatsoever.

Make the following change to allow REGEDIT.EXE to run:

1) Right-click this page > Properties > note the zone, e.g., Local Intranet  
2) Tools menu
3) Internet Options
4) Security tab
5) Select the correct zone, e.g., Local Intranet
6) Custom Level button
7) Set to Enabled the following option and save changes:

    "Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe for scripting"

8) Now refresh the page to launch REGEDIT.EXE
9) Right-click the web page > View Source


[Don't forget to reset the option to Disabled afterwards.]
