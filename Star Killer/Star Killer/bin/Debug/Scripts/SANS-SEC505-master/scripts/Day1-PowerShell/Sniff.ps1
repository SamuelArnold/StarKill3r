#.Synopsis 
#    Colorize the output of windump.exe (http://www.winpcap.org/windump/),
#    a command-line packet sniffer and protocol analyzer for Windows.
#
#.Description 
#    Run the script instead of windump.exe directly, or extract the 
#    colorize-windump() filter and pipe windump.exe into it. The various
#    fields of the packet traces, such as IP addresses and timestamps, will
#    be color-coded for easier reading and analysis.  Pass in command-line
#    options like normal, except that they must be placed in double-quotes.
#    Use the -Ask switch to be prompted for the correct adapter number. 
#    Requires PowerShell 2.0 or later (and windump.exe of course).
#
#.Parameter Options
#    The command-line arguments for windump.exe (in double-quotes).
#
#.Parameter Spacing
#    Number of blank lines printed between each packet displayed.
#
#.Parameter AskWhichAdapter
#    Will display the list of network adapters and prompt to choose one.
#
#.Example 
#    sniff
#
#.Example 
#	 sniff -ask
#
#.Example 
#    sniff "-X -v" -spacing 1 -ask
#
#Requires -Version 2.0
