Background jobs are different than scheduled tasks.  Tasks are run by 
the Task Scheduler service whether or not PowerShell is running and
do not require a user to be logged onto the computer.  A background
job, by contrast, is launched by PowerShell, runs as a part of a 
PowerShell session, and normally initiated by a logged on user.

Background jobs run hidden in the background of a PowerShell session.
After launching a background job, the PowerShell prompt becomes
immediately available to the user for executing new commands.  

Background jobs are useful for commands that require a long time to
complete, such as remoting to hundreds of other computers or copying
terabytes of files.  

Keep in mind that a background job is tied to a running instance
of PowerShell.  If you close PowerShell, any jobs associated with that
PowerShell session, running or finished, will be lost.  To run a
command which survives the termination of PowerShell or the logging
off of all users on a computer, use a scheduled task instead.

The Start-Job cmdlet and the -AsJob switch of Invoke-Command and
Get-WmiObject are the most common ways of launching background jobs.
The output produced by a job is obtained with the Receive-Job cmdlet.

Note that the output of background job is captured, converted to XML
(serialized), passed back to the parent PowerShell process, then 
converted back to objects again (deserialized); hence, to maximize
performance, try to limit the quantity of data returned by each job.
Also, there is overhead to spawning the job processes --this isn't
multi-threading or using the Task Parallel Library (TPL)-- so it is
not always faster to spawn multiple short-lived jobs than to just
do it all in the parent PowerShell process; testing is required.
Finally, avoid running more jobs concurrently than you have CPU cores,
and perhaps reduce this by half when there is lots of disk I/O.  

***Scheduled Tasks vs. Scheduled Jobs***
To make things a bit more confusing, you can also have scheduled jobs
in addition to scheduled tasks.  There is a difference.

With PowerShell 3.0 or later on Windows 8, Server 2012 or later, try:

    Get-Command -Module ScheduledTasks
    Get-Command -Module PsScheduledJob

The tools used to view and manage scheduled tasks can also be used
to view and manage scheduled jobs.  But the above cmdlets that are 
unique to scheduled jobs can only be used jobs, not with generic tasks,
and to create a scheduled job, you must use a job cmdlet. But after the
job is created, you can still see it in Task Scheduler (look in 
Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs). 

Importantly, the output of your scheduled jobs are automatically saved to:

    $Home\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScheduledJobs\<*job*>\Output

$Home is the path to your local user profile folder.
    
So, when to use scheduled tasks versus scheduled jobs?  Use tasks by
default, except when you want to more conveniently capture the output
of a PowerShell or native command, then use a scheduled job.  If you
want simplicity, then ignore scheduled jobs entirely, only use tasks,
and then output whatever data you want to whichever folder you want
when you run PowerShell commands via a scheduled task.

# To run a command as a background job:
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { Test-Connection -ComputerName 'www.yahoo.com' -Count 50 } 


# To run a script as a background job:
Start-Job -FilePath .\SomeScript.ps1 


# To see what background jobs currently exist, running or otherwise:
Get-Job


# The details of a job include its run state, the command executed, name of the
# job, the ID number of the job, begin/end times, child jobs, errors, etc.  The
# output of a background job is actually contained in the child job(s).


# To see the details of a particular job by specifying job name or job ID number:
Get-Job -Name 'Job3' | Format-List *
Get-Job -Id 3 | Format-List *


# To see the child job(s) of a background job:
Get-Job -Id 3 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty ChildJobs | Format-List *


# To get the output produced by a background job and remove the data from the job object:
$Output = Receive-Job -Name 'Job3' 


# To get a job's output and REMOVE the data from the job afterwards:
$Output = Receive-Job -Name 'Job3' 


# Note: When a job is still running, you can receive its output so far and this action
# will not stop or pause the activities of the running job.  However, any data received 
# will be removed from the job object by default, unless you choose to -Keep it.


# To get a job's output and NOT remove the data from the job afterwards:
$Output = Receive-Job -Name 'Job3' -Keep


# To wait for a job to finish, holding the command prompt and blocking new commands until finished:
Wait-Job -Id 4     #You can use job ID or job name in all these examples.


# To wait for a job to finish, get its output, and delete the job object itself afterwards:
$Output = Receive-Job -Name 'Job3' -Wait -AutoRemoveJob


# To execute a set of commands or a script on multiple remote machines 
# as a background job, query the status of the job, then capture the
# output of the job (the commands on the machines) to a variable which
# includes the name of the target computer as a property on each object:
$Servers = @("Server7", "Server8", "Server9")
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $Servers -ScriptBlock { ps } -AsJob
Get-Job    #Query status, see the ID number, and look for State = Completed.
$Output = Receive-Job -ID 6    
$Output | Format-Table PSComputerName,ProcessName -AutoSize


# To see which commands support an -AsJob switch:
Get-Command -ParameterName AsJob | ft name



# Jobs can also be suspended, resumed, stopped and removed:
#   Suspend-Job, Resume-Job, Stop-Job, Remove-Job
