# The intent is to optimize TCP performance by setting the
# receive window auto-tuning level to Disabled.




# To disable TCP/IP autotunning, in an elevated CMD shell run:

netsh.exe interface tcp set global autotuninglevel= disabled



# To see current TCP global settings and to confirm 
# that "Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level" is disabled:

netsh.exe interface tcp show global



# To reset back to the factory default:
# netsh.exe interface tcp set global autotuninglevel= normal
