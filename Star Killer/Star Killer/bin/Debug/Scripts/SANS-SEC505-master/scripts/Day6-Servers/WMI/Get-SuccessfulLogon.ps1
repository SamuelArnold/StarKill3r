#.Synopsis 
#    Extract successful logon events from the security event log. 
#
#.Description 
#    Extract logon events information from the security event log on
#    a local or remote Windows Vista, Server 2008 or later computer. 
#    Windows XP, Server 2003 and earlier systems are not supported. 
#
#.Parameter ComputerName
#    Preferably the fully-qualified domain named (FQDN) of the computer from
#    which to extract logon events, though a simple hostname or IP can also
#    work assuming NTLM is permitted.  Defaults to the local computer.
#
#.Parameter WithinLastHours
#    The number of hours in the past from which to extract logon events.
#    Using fractional hours is permitted, e.g., 0.1 or 0.25 or 0.50.
#    Defaults to showing only logons within the prior one hour only. 
#    Careful, there is a quota limit to how many events can be returned!
# 
#.Parameter InteractiveLogons
#    Use this switch to include interactive logons.  This is the default
#    if no other switches are used.
#
#.Parameter NetworkLogons
#    Use this switch to include over-the-network logons.  Does not include
#    computer account logons unless -IncludeComputerAccountLogons is also
#    specified, in which case "network" logons of the computer to itself
#    are included as well.
#
#.Parameter ServiceLogons
#    Use this switch to include the logons of background services and
#    other processes launched using the Windows service facility.
#
#.Parameter ScheduledTaskLogons
#    Use this switch to include logons exercising the batch logon right,
#    which is usually for scheduled tasks configured to run as real users.
#
#.Parameter AllLogons
#    Use this switch to include all logon types, except for computer
#    account logons, which requires -IncludeComputerAccountLogons too.
#
#.Parameter IncludeComputerAccountLogons
#    Use this switch to include successful logons from other computers and
#    also logons from the local computer to itself.  By default, only the
#    logons of users are outputted. (Strictly speaking, it's only the logons
#    of account names not ending with "$" which are outputted by default).
#
#.Example 
#    get-successfullogon -computername server47.sans.org -withinlasthours 24
#
#.Example 
#    get-successfullogon -interactive -withinlasthours 0.5
#
#.Example 
#    get-successfullogon -withinlasthours 96 -alllogons -includecomputeraccountlogons
#
#Requires -Version 2.0
