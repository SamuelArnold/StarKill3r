#.Synopsis 
#    Creates and deletes sinkhole domains in Windows DNS servers. 
#
#.Description 
#    Script takes fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) and/or simple domain
#    names, then uses them to create primary zones (not Active Directory
#    integrated) in a Windows DNS server, setting all zones to resolve to a
#    single chosen IP address.  The IP address might be "0.0.0.0" or the IP  
#    of an internal server configured for logging.  The intention is to 
#    prevent clients from resolving the correct IP address of unwanted FQDNs
#    and domain names, such as for malware and phishing sites.  Such names
#    are said to be "sinkholed" or "blackholed" since they often resolve 
#    to 0.0.0.0, which is an inaccessible IP address.    
#
#.Parameter InputFile  
#    Path to a file which contains the FQDNs and domain names to sinkhole.
#    File can have blank lines, comment lines (# or ;), multiple FQDNs or
#    domains per line (space- or comma-delimited), and can be a hosts file 
#    with IP addresses too (addresses and localhost entires will be ignored).  
#    You can also include wildcards to input multiple files, e.g., 
#    "*bad*.txt", or pass in an array of file objects instead of a string.  
#
#.Parameter Domain
#    One or more FQDNs or domains to sinkhole, separated by spaces or commas.
#
#.Parameter SinkHoleIP
#    The IP address to which all sinkholed names will resolve.  The
#    default is "0.0.0.0", but perhaps is better set to an internal server.
#    Remember, there is only one IP for ALL the sinkholed domains.
#
#.Parameter DnsServerName
#    FQDN of the Windows DNS server.  Defaults to localhost.  If specified,
#    please always use a fully-qualified domain name (FQDN), especially if
#    the DNS server is a stand-alone or in a different domain.
#
#.Parameter IncludeWildCard
#    Will add a wildcard host record (*) to every sinkhole domain, which 
#    will match all possible hostnames within that domain.  Keep in mind
#    that sinkholing "www.sans.org" will treat the "www" as a domain
#    name, so a wildcard is not needed to match it; but sinkholing just
#    "sans.org" will not match "www.sans.org" or "ftp.sans.org" without
#    the wildcard.  If you only want to sinkhole the exact FQDN or domain
#    name supplied to the script, then don't include a wildcard record.  
#    If you are certain that you do not want to resolve anything whatsoever
#    under the sinkholed domains, then include the wildcard DNS record.
#
#.Parameter ReloadSinkHoleDomains
#    Will cause every sinkholed domain in your DNS server to re-read the
#    one shared zone file they all use.  This is the zone file for the
#    000-sinkholed-domain.local domain.  Keep in mind that the DNS
#    graphical management tool shows you what is cached in memory, not
#    what is in the zone file.  Reload the sinkhole domains if you,
#    for example, change the sinkhole IP address.  Using this switch
#    causes any other parameters to be ignored.
#
#.Parameter DeleteSinkHoleDomains
#    Will delete all sinkhole domains, but will not delete any regular 
#    non-sinkhole domains.  Strictly speaking, this deletes any domain 
#    which uses a zone file named "000-sinkholed-domain.local.dns".
#    The zone file itself is not deleted, but it only 1KB in size.  
#    Using this switch causes any other parameters to be ignored.
#
#.Parameter RemoveLeadingWWW
#    Some lists of sinkhole names are simple domain names, while other
#    lists might prepend "www." to the beginning of many of the names.
#    Use this switch to remove the "www." from the beginning of any
#    name to be sinkholed, then consider using -IncludeWildCard too.
#    Note that "www.", "www1.", "www2." ... "www9." will be cut too, 
#    but only for a single digit after the "www" part (1-9 only).
#
#.Parameter Credential
#    An "authority\username" string to explicitly authenticate to the
#    DNS server instead of using single sign-on with the current
#    identity.  The authority is either a server name or a domain name.
#    You will be prompted for the passphrase.  You can also pass in
#    a variable with a credential object from Get-Credential.
#    
#.Example 
#    .\Sinkhole-DNS.ps1 -Domain "www.sans.org"
#    
#    This will create a primary DNS domain named "www.sans.org"
#    which will resolve to "0.0.0.0".  DNS server is local.  
#
#.Example 
#    .\Sinkhole-DNS.ps1 -Domain "www.sans.org" -SinkHoleIP "10.1.1.1"
#
#    This will create a primary DNS domain named "www.sans.org"
#    which will resolve to "10.1.1.1".  DNS server is local.
#
#.Example 
#    .\Sinkhole-DNS.ps1 -InputFile file.txt -IncludeWildCard
#
#    This will create DNS domains out of all the FQDNs and domain
#    names listed in file.txt, plus add a wildcard (*) record.
#
#.Example 
#    .\Sinkhole-DNS.ps1 -ReloadSinkHoleDomains
#
#    Perhaps after changing the sinkhole IP address, this will cause
#    all sinkholed domains to re-read their shared zone file.
#
#.Example 
#    .\Sinkhole-DNS.ps1 -DeleteSinkHoleDomains
#
#    This will delete all sinkholed domains, but will not delete
#    any other domains.  This does not delete the sinkhole zone file.
#
#.Example
#    .\Sinkhole-DNS.ps1 -InputFile file.txt -DnsServerName `
#            "server7.sans.org" -Credential "server7\administrator"
#
#    This will create sinkholed domains from file.txt on a remote
#    DNS server named "server7.sans.org" with explicit credentials.
#    You will be prompted for the passphrase.   
#
#.Example
#    $Cred = Get-Credential -Credential "server7\administrator"
#
#    .\Sinkhole-DNS.ps1 -InputFile *evil*.txt `
#         -DnsServerName "server7.sans.org" -Credential $Cred
#
#    This will create sinkholed domains from *evil*.txt on a remote
#    DNS server named "server7.sans.org" with explicit credentials 
#    supplied in a credential object ($Cred) which can be reused again.
#    Multiple input files may match "*evil*.txt".  
#
#Requires -Version 2.0
