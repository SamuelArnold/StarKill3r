.SYNOPSIS
 Manage the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value (KB951016).

.DESCRIPTION
 Manage the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value (KB951016). This value
 controls whether network logons to a computer using a local account defined on
 that computer will have a normal, full, unmodified Security Access Token ($Setting = 1)
 or a Security Access Token which has been stripped of it's dangerous privileges
 and administrative group memberships ($Setting = 0, the default).

    .SYNOPSIS
     Returns the setting of the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value (KB951016).

    .DESCRIPTION
     The LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value controls whether network logons to a 
     computer using a local account defined on that computer will have a normal, full, 
     unmodified Security Access Token (returns 1) or a Security Access Token which has 
     been stripped of it's dangerous privileges and administrative group memberships 
     (returns 0, which is the factory default). This impacts whether a local user may be
     used for tasks like PowerShell remoting and system administration (0 = No, 1 = Yes). 
     See KB951016 for more information, the issues are complex and potentially compromising.
     Use the -Verbose switch to show additional information about consequences.

function Set-LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
{
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
     Sets the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value (KB951016).

    .DESCRIPTION
     The LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry value controls whether network logons to a 
     computer using a local account defined on that computer will have a normal, full, 
     unmodified Security Access Token (returns 1) or a Security Access Token which has 
     been stripped of it's dangerous privileges and administrative group memberships 
     (returns 0, which is the factory default). This impacts whether a local user may be
     used for tasks like PowerShell remoting and system administration (0 = No, 1 = Yes). 
     This does not apply to the built-in local Administrator account, however, for which
     the effective value is always 1, that is to say, the Administrator's SAT is unmodified.
     See KB951016 for more information, the issues are complex and potentially compromising.
     Use the -Verbose switch to show additional information about consequences. Note that
     changes to this value take effect immediately, no reboot required. Function outputs
     true or false to indicate successful setting of the registry value. 

    .PARAMETER Settings
     Mandatory, must be 0 or 1. There is no default for the function (Windows defaults to 0 
     because, by default, the registry value does not exist).  Setting to 0 has the same
     effect as deleting the value from the registry. Function cannot delete the value.
