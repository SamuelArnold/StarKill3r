#.Synopsis 
#    Carefully delete only the correct password archive files previously
#    created with the companion script named Update-PasswordArchive.ps1. 
#
#.Description 
#    Deletes older password archive files while retaining a chosen number 
#    (default = 5) of prior successful and failed archive files for each
#    unique combination of computer and user (total of 10 files by default
#    for each unique combination).  Scheduling this script will help to
#    maintain a reasonable number of password archive files.
#
#.Parameter PasswordArchivePath 
#    The local or UNC path to where the encrypted password files are kept. 
#
#.Parameter ComputerName
#    Name of the computer with the local account whose password was reset
#    and whose password was encrypted and saved to a file.  The computer
#    name will match the names of files in the PasswordArchivePath.  This
#    parameter can accept a computer name with a wildcard in it.  When 
#    specified, only the archives for that computer (or for those matching
#    computers with a wildcard) will be cleaned up instead of the default,
#    which is to clean up archive files for all computers.
#
#.Parameter ArchivesToKeep
#    The number of current and prior password archive files to keep for
#    each combination of computer name and user name.  A single computer
#    might have multiple local user accounts whose passwords are managed
#    by these scripts, so the clean up must handle this gracefully. The
#    default is 5 (5 successful files + 5 failures files = 10 files).
#
#.Parameter VerboseReporting
#    Switch to show verbose information.
#
#.Parameter DoNotDelete
#    Switch to do a -WhatIf dry run that will not actually delete any
#    files.  Use this switch along with -VerboseReporting for testing.
#
#.Parameter DeleteAllPasswordArchives
#    Switch to delete all password archive files without exception.
#
#.Example 
#    .\CleanUp-PasswordArchive.ps1 -PasswordArchivePath \\server\share
#
#    Deletes all but the last 5 password archive files for each computer
#    and user combination.  Also, deletes all but the last 5 failure-type
#    files for each combination.  Hence, if the last successful reset was
#    six months ago, followed by many failures, the last 5 successful
#    reset archive files will *not* be deleted.
#
#.Example 
#    .\CleanUp-PasswordArchive.ps1 -PasswordArchivePath \\server\share -ComputerName WKS*
#
#    Only cleans up the archive files for computers which match the "WKS*" file 
#    pattern.  A full computer name can be specified, wildcards are not required.  
#    Regular expressions are not supported.
# 
#.Example 
#    .\CleanUp-PasswordArchive.ps1 -PasswordArchivePath \\server\share -DoNotDelete -VerboseReporting
#
#    No files will be deleted, but a verbose report of files discovered will be shown.
#
