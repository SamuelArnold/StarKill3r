# IPSec pre-shared keys are stored in plaintext in GPOs and in the
# registry under HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\
# Parameters\FirewallPolicy\Phase1AuthenticationSets.  This is not
# news, Microsoft warned of this issue years ago. 


# Run this command to extract local pre-shared keys: 

Get-NetIPsecPhase1AuthSet |
Select-Object -ExpandProperty Proposal |
Where { $_.AuthenticationMethod -eq 'PreSharedKey' } |
Select-Object -ExpandProperty PreSharedKey
