#.Synopsis 
#    Compare the list of root certification authorities (CAs) trusted by a user 
#    on a computer against a reference list of CAs.  The reference list is just a 
#    simple text file of the hash thumbprints of root CA certificates. 
#
#.Description
#    Compare the list of root certification authorities (CAs) trusted by a user 
#    on a computer against a reference list CAs.  The reference list is just a 
#    simple text file of the hash thumbprints of the CA certificates.  The
#    output is a CSV text file of the currently-trusted certificates which are
#    NOT in the reference list.  Script also writes an event to the Application
#    event log (Event ID = 9017, Source = RootCertificateAudit) on the computer
#    where the script is run.  The script is quite simple, actually, and is
#    mainly intended as a starter script or skeleton script to be modified for
#    the needs of the organization; feel free to add more error handling, etc.
#
#.Parameter PathToReferenceList 
#    The local or UNC path to the text file containing the list of certificate
#    hash thumbprints against which to compare as a reference.
#
#.Parameter OutputPath
#    The local or UNC path to the folder for the output CSV file which will contain 
#    a list of the currently-trusted root CAs which are NOT on the reference
#    list of hashes, hence, possibly bad or in violation of policy.
#
#Requires -Version 2.0
