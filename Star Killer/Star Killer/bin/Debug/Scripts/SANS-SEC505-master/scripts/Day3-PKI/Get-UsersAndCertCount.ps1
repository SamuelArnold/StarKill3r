#.Synopsis
#   Outputs paths to users in AD with more than one certificate.
#
#.Description
#   Script outputs the paths to user accounts in Active Directory which have more
#   than one certificate, plus the count of total certificates in AD for each user.
#   This is useful when cleaning up a PKI deployment where duplicate certificates 
#   were not suppressed properly through template options and credentials roaming.
#   Leave $SearchRoot empty to search entire domain, or enter the
#   DN path to an OU, e.g., "LDAP://OU=There,DC=Company,DC=Net".
#   Does not return users with zero certificates because of SizeLimit
#   issues which limit the results returned to 1000 by default:
