#.Synopsis 
#    Delete chosen trusted root CA certificates. 
#
#.Description
#    Edit the $BadCerts array in this script prior to execution.  The $BadCerts
#    array contains the hash thumbprints of root Certification Authority (CA)
#    certificates which should be deleted.  The script writes its report to the
#    shell and also to the Application event log (Event ID = 9019).
#
#Requires -Version 2.0
